# SLAM Tools Repository

Welcome to the SLAM Tools Repository! This project aims to gather and maintain a collection of widely-used SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms implemented in C++. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in SLAM technologies.

## Included Algorithms

- **ORB-SLAM2**
- **ORB-SLAM3**
- **LSD-SLAM**
- **DSO (Direct Sparse Odometry)**
- **VINS-Mono**
- ...and more to come!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to add a new SLAM algorithm, improve existing implementations, or enhance documentation, your help is appreciated. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
3. **Make your changes** and ensure they are well-documented.
4. **Test your changes** to ensure they work as expected.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

Please make sure to follow the coding style and guidelines provided in the repository to maintain consistency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SLAM tools, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the respective algorithm directories. Each directory contains a `CMakeLists.txt` file to help you build the project.
